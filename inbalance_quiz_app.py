        Your responses suggest your cycle may not be consistently ovulatory. This may relate to mood shifts,
        mild acne, or irregular periods. It‚Äôs worth keeping an eye on ovulation and energy trends.

        You show moderate signs commonly associated with PCOS ‚Äî such as irregular cycles, skin or hair changes, or weight issues.
        We recommend confirming this with a healthcare provider and tracking symptoms closely.
