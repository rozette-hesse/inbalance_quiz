    """

elif total < 16:
    diagnosis = "Ovulatory Imbalance"
    explanation = f"""
    Your answers suggest that ovulation may not be happening regularly ‚Äî or may be disrupted by stress, inflammation, or blood sugar swings.  
    These patterns often show up as irregular periods, fatigue, skin issues, or mood shifts.

    üëâ Supporting ovulation through gentle lifestyle changes ‚Äî like eating enough, sleeping better, and stabilizing blood sugar ‚Äî can make a difference.  
    InBalance helps you see your personal patterns and guides you with expert-backed tips.

    üëâ InBalance gives you tools to balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and track improvements ‚Äî while experts help guide your care.
